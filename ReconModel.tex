\title{PA Recon}
\author{David Fuentes}
\begin{document}                % The start of the document
\maketitle


The presence of deoxyhemoglobin PA signal provides a biomarker for locating
aggressive prostate cancer.  Spectral unmixing to differentiate deoxy- (HHb)
and oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) PA signal is achieved using inverse analysis
applied to physics based models of the reconstruction. 
Modeling the reconstruction involves: (Section~\ref{FluenceSource})
estimating the initial pressure distribution from the absorbed light source
and (Section~\ref{WavePropagation}) propagating the acoustic wave from the
initial pressure distribution to the ultrasound receiver hardware.
An information theoretic mathematical framework for adaptive sampling and 
identifying wavelength and SNR
acquistion parameters that provide the most information content 
with respect to the physics model based data collection
is presented in Section~\ref{GeneralMathFramework}.
The MATLAB script \texttt{exampleRecon.m} documents the user interface
developed, Section~\ref{UserInterface}. 
The interface allows the operator to denote needle insertion
points within the global DICOM frame. GPU kernels are provided
for compute intensive elements of the pipeline to enable high
throughput processing.

%Subtask 2: A likelihood volume will be generated in MATLAB by taking the
%product of all hypoxia maps and corresponding SNR maps and spatially
%registering (based on encoder data) each likelihood map (generated from
%every acquired imaging plane) in a volumetric reference frame.
%
%Subtask 3: A user interface will be developed in MATLAB that allows the
%operator to denote needle insertion points and phantom margins in the global
%reference frame. Although the prototype system detailed herein requires
%offline processing, a future system would permit quasi-real-time
%processing/data registration to allow for iterative (i.e., after each needle
%placement) calculation of the likelihood maps/volume.      
%
%Milestone Achieved: PA-needle imaging data and position data will be
%integrated into a MATLAB-based interface to provide adaptive likelihood
%maps. 

Tradeoffs between accuracy in the physics based predictions and numerical
efficiency are considered within the context of the model-based
reconstruction. A key idea of our approach is that clinically significant
spatial variations of sO2 may be detected using the appropriate numerical
approximations. Ie, full numerical solution to the coupled partial
differential equations that govern the inherent fluence and pressure for
photoacoustic detection are not needed.

\color{blue}
Numerical methods for the inverse analysis will include analytical gradient
information of the misfit between the predictions of the model based
reconstruction against measured data. Gradient information obtained from
numerical solutions of the adjoint partial differential equations are known
to provide the most efficient numerical solution techniques within a
quasi-Newton optimization framework \cite{maclellan2013estimating,fuentesetal12a}. 
Alone, model based
reconstruction of spatial variations of the optical properties is ill-posed
in the sense that not enough information is collected to determine pixel
wise variations of the optical properties. Total variation techniques will
be applied to regularize the spatial dependence of solution. Additional
regularization terms will include prior knowledge of physically acceptable
bound of the optical properties. This may also be implemented within a bound
constrained optimization framework.
All numerical methods will be validated in controlled phantom experiments of
known HHb and HbO2 concentrations, see Specific Aim 2. Accurate
reconstructions within this controlled setting will provide confidence in
applying the numerical techniques in-vivo.

\section{Mathematical Framework}\label{GeneralMathFramework}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The underlying philosophy and assumptions within our approach is that the physics 
models are 1st order accurate or within 70-80\% of the needed accuracy and the error is
adequate within the assumed Gaussian noise.
Gaussian distributions provide analytical representations of the random
variables of interest (ie volume fraction of HHb, $\phi$) within the Bayesian setting and 
provide a crux for understanding. In particular, we say that a random
variable $\eta$ belongs to a multi-variate normal distribution 
of mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^n $ and covariance $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$
\[
     \eta \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)  
    \Rightarrow
      p(\eta)  = \frac{1}{2 \; \pi \; \det{\Sigma}} \exp\left( - \frac{1}{2} \| \mu - \eta\|^2_{\Sigma}\right)
\]


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Our data acquistion model, $\mathcal{G}(\vec{k},\theta): \mathbb{R}^a
\times \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n $,
maps deterministic acquisition
parameters, $\vec{k} \in \mathbb{R}^a$, and uncertain parameters, $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m$
to observables, $\vec{z} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ ( or $\vec{z} \in \mathbb{C}^n$).
Explicitly, we will assume that the
measurement models are corrupted by zero mean white noise noise of a
\textbf{known} covariance matrix, $\Sigma_z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ 
\begin{equation}
\label{sensormodelstructure}
\begin{split}
  \vec{z} & = \mathcal{G}(\vec{k};\theta) + \eta   \qquad   \eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma_z)
      \\
  \vec{k} & =  \text{(frequency, laser position, etc)}
      \\
  \theta &  =  \text{(volume fraction, absorption, etc)}
     \end{split}
\end{equation}
$\eta$ may be interpreted as the measurement noise or the acquisition noise
in the sensor model. For a deterministic measurement model $\mathcal{G}$,
the conditional probablity distribution has an explicit analytical form
and may be written as a  \textbf{known} Gaussian
distribution. 
  \[ 
      p(\vec{z}|\theta)   =  \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{G}(\vec{k};\theta),\Sigma_z)  
  \]
  \item Additional \textbf{known} information is the prior probability
distributions for the model parameters, $p(\theta)$.  For simplicity,
    assume that Prior parameters are Gaussian distributed of 
   \textbf{known} mean, $\hat{\theta}$ and covariance, $\Sigma_\theta$
   \[
      \theta \sim \mathcal{N} (\hat{\theta}, \Sigma_\theta)
   \]
  \item Bayes theorem is fundamental to the approach.
\[
p(y|x) p(x) = p(x,y) = p(x|y) p(y)
\]
Bayes rule may be applied to simplify this expression
to the expected value of the KL-distance
\[
p(\theta,z) = p(\theta|z) \; p(z)
            = p(z|\theta) \; p(\theta)
\]
The probability of the measurements $p(z)$ must be interprited in terms of the
known information. The probability of the measurements may be derived from
the marginalization of the joint probability and has the interpretation as
the projection of the joint probability onto the measurement axis.
\[
  p(z) = \int_\theta p(\theta,z)  \; d\theta 
       = \int_\theta p(\theta|z) \; p(\theta)\; d\theta 
\]
Similarly, the probabilty of the model parameters given the data,
$p(\theta|z)$ in understood from Bayes rule.
\[
       p(\theta|z) = \frac{ p(z|\theta) \; p(\theta)} {p(z)}
\]
  \item  The concept of informational entropy~\cite{Madankan15}, $H(Z)$,
provides a mathematically rigorous framework to look for measurement acquisition
parameters, $\vec{k}$, with the high information content of the reconstruction.
Given a probability space 
$(\Omega, \mathcal{F},p)$ (probability maps from the
sigma-algebra of possible events $p:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow [0,1]$
sigma-algebra, $\mathcal{F}$, defined on set of `outcomes' $\Omega$
\cite{durrett2010probability}),
we will define information of an event  as
proportional to the inverse probability.
\[
\text{information} \equiv  \frac{1}{p(\theta)}
\]
Intuitively, when a low probability event occurs this provides high
information.
The informational entropy is an \textit{average}
of the information content for a sigma algebra of events $\mathcal{F}$
\[
H(Z) = \int_Z  p(Z) \ln\frac{1}{p(Z)}
\]
Hence this entropy measure is an average of the information content
for a given set of events, $\mathcal{F}$, and is proportional to the
variance or uncertainty in which the set of events occur.
This agrees with thermodynamic entropy;
if the information containing events are completely spread out such as in a
uniform distribution, the entropy is maxmized.
The entropy
is zero for a probability distribution in which
only one event occurs. Zero information is gained when the same event
always occurs ($0 \ln\frac{1}{0} = 0$). 
With this interpretation in mind, we want to find acquisition parameters,
$\vec{k}$, for which the model parameters, $\Theta$, contains the most 
information about the measurements $Z$. 
 


\begin{itemize} 
\item Yet another motivation for the use of Gaussian distributions
is that the Entropy is analytic~\cite{ahmed1989entropy}
for a multivariate Gaussian random variable, $X$.
\begin{equation} \label{GaussianEntropy}
X\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)
\qquad
\mu \in \mathbb{R}^n
\qquad
H(X) = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left((2 \; \pi \; e)^n  \; \det \Sigma \right) 
\end{equation}


\end{itemize} 
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
The optimal acquistion parameters $\vec{k}$ maximize the mutual information
\[
 \max_k I(\theta,z)
\]
As a more tractable alternative direction, a sensitivity analysis may be
used to locate the measurements that provide the most variance in model
predictions for uncertain parameters, $\theta$
\[
 \max_k \left< \mathcal{G}_i(\vec{k};\theta)  \right>
\]
Alternatively, we may consider moments variance as an approximation
of quanitities of interest,
$Q(\theta)$
\[
   \mathbb{E}[Q] = \int p(\theta) q(\theta) \; d\theta
\]
\end{minipage} }

Reconstruction methods will incorporate the spatial distribution of the
absorption and scattering into the expected time dependent photo-acoustic
signal of a single wavelength excitation. 

The assembled research team has significant experience implementing
numerical methods for inverse analysis of diffusion-based light transport
models in turbid media
\cite{maclellan2013estimating,fuentesetal12a,fuentesetal09,Fuentesetal08}, 
including directional models of light
propagation using considerations of the delta-Eddington phase function 
\cite{maclellan2013estimating,fuentesetal12a}. 
Directional methods are needed to model the light irradiation patterns
seen in Figure 4. A key idea of the inverse analysis is that the optical
absorption provides the image contrast within the spectral unmixing. 
Within our application, the optical absorption, μa, is considered a linear
combination of the volume fractions, $\phi$, of deoxy- (HHb) and oxyhemoglobin
(HbO2) constituents.
\[
\mu_a (\lambda,x) = \phi \mu_a^\text{HHb} (\lambda,x) + (1-\phi)\mu_a^\text{HbO2} (\lambda,x)
\]
Spatial variations in the optical absorption are directly related to hypoxic
regions and will be detected by exploiting the frequency dependence of the
optical properties.

The starting point for modeling light transport in tissue is the Boltzman
equation for the radiance, $L(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})$.
\begin{equation}\label{TransportEquation}
\hat{s} \cdot \nabla L(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})
+ \mu_t (\mathbf{r})  L(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})
 = 
\mu_s \int_{4\pi} p(\hat{s},\hat{s}') L(\mathbf{r},\hat{s}) \; d \omega
\qquad
\mu_t = \mu_a + \mu_s
\end{equation}
Here the radiance,  $L(\mathbf{r},\hat{s}) $, represents the radiant power per unit
of solid angle about unit vector $\hat{s}$ and per unit area perpendicular
$\hat{s}$.
The Boltzman equation represents a conservation of energy applied to light
energy transport in tissue at point $r$.
The phase function, $p(\hat{s},\hat{s}')$, provides a measure of the
probability of a scattering photons traveling in direction $\hat{s}'$ 
into the direction $\hat{s}$. The mean cosine  of the scattering angle
is known as the anisotropy factor, $g$
\[
 \int_{4\pi} p(\hat{s} \cdot \hat{s}')(\hat{s} \cdot \hat{s}') d\omega' \equiv g
\]

By convention, the radiance is considered as the summation of a
\textit{known} primary light source with irradiance, $E(\mathbf{r})$, traveling in
direction $s_0$ and scattered light source.
\[
  L(\mathbf{r},\hat{s}) = L_p(\mathbf{r},\hat{s}) + L_s(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})
               = \frac{E(\mathbf{r})  \delta( 1 - \hat{s} \cdot \hat{s}_0)}{
2\pi}  + L_s(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})
\]
The scattered radiance may be represented as sum of spherical harmonics,
this is known as the P-n approximation\cite{Welch95,Modest2003}. 
\[
  L_s(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})  = \sum^\infty_i L_i(\mathbf{r}) P_i(\hat{s})
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Standard Diffusion Approximation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\color{red}
When only the first two terms are used, this is known as the
P-1\cite{Modest2003} or diffusion approximation\cite{Modest2003}. 
}
\begin{equation} \label{DiffusionApproximation}
  L_s(\mathbf{r},\hat{s})  \approx \frac{1}{4 \pi} \varphi_d(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{3}{4} \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \hat{s}
\end{equation}
When i=0,1,2,3 terms are kept, this is known as the P-3
approximation. The P-2 approximation is generally less accurate and not
used\cite{Modest2003}.

The diffusion model for light transport is valid under the assumption
that light is scattered more than absorbed.
\[
\mu_a << \mu_s(1-g)  \Rightarrow \mu_{eff} << \mu_t
\]

The PDE for the SDA is obtained in two steps by (i) substituting \eqn{DiffusionApproximation}
into \eqn{TransportEquation} and integrating over all solid angles and (ii)
multipling \eqn{TransportEquation}  by $\hat{s}$ and integrating over all
solid angles. Combining the result yeilds
\[ \begin{split}
\nabla\cdot \left( \frac{1}{3 \mu_{tr} } \nabla \varphi_d(\mathbf{r}) \right)  & - \mu_a \varphi_d(\mathbf{r}) 
= 
- \mu_s E(\mathbf{r})
+ \nabla  \cdot  \left( \frac{g \mu_s }{\mu_{tr}} E(\mathbf{r})  \hat{s}_0 \right) 
\\
& \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{-1}{3 \mu_{tr}} 
\left[
 \nabla \varphi_d(\mathbf{r}) - 3 g \mu_s E(\mathbf{r}) \hat{s}_0
\right]
\end{split}
\qquad
\begin{split}
\mu_s' = \mu_s (1-g)
\quad
\mu_{tr} = \mu_a + \mu_s'
\\
\mu_{eff} = \sqrt{3\mu_a  \mu_{tr}}
\end{split}
\]
$\mathbf{j}$ is the radiant flux, $\hat{z}$ is the direction of the collimated light, etc...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Homogenious Coefficients}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\cite{fuentesetal10a}
\textbf{
This does not work for heterogenious case!!!
The analytic solution uses method of undetermined coefficients
which only works for homogenious case!!!
}
Consider Pennes model coupled to a diffusion theory model of light
transport in tissue. The total fluence at a point is given by the
sum of the scattered and primary light $\varphi_t(x,t) = z(x,t) + E(x,t)$.

Through the diffusion model,
the scattered fluence $z$ is obtained from the 
known irradiance $E(x,t)$ (primary source of photons) 
and its flux $\textbf{F}(x,t)$.
\textbf{
justified in calling $\textbf{F}(x,t)$  the flux of the irradiance ???
}
\[
\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3 \mu_{tr} } \nabla \varphi_d(\mathbf{r}) \right)
 - \mu_a \varphi_d(\mathbf{r}) 
= 
- \mu_s^*  E(\mathbf{r})
+   \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{g^* \mu_s^*}{\mu_{tr}} E(\mathbf{r}) \hat{s}_0 \right)
\]
\[
 \frac{1}{c(x)}
 \frac{\partial(z+E)}{\partial t}
 -{\color{red}\mu_a(\textbf{x})} z 
 +{\color{red}\mu_s^*(\textbf{x},m)} E
 = \nabla \cdot 
   \left( 
   - \frac{ \nabla z }{3\mu_{tr}(\textbf{x},m)} 
   + \frac{ {\color{red}\mu_s^*}(\textbf{x},m) g^* }{3\mu_{tr}(\textbf{x},m)}
       \textbf{F}
   \right)
\qquad
  \mu_{tr}(\textbf{x},m)  = 
                 {\color{red}\mu_a(\textbf{x},m)} + 
                    {\color{red}\mu_s(\textbf{x},m)} (1-g)
\]
The irradiance is provided by a photon flux emitted throughout
the domain of an interstitial laser fiber $\Omega_{tip}$.
The photons are emittied by an applied power density,
$P^* \left[\frac{W}{m^3}\right]$. Each position in the domain $\hat{x}$
is treated as a point source of irradiance
\[
dE(x,\hat{x})= 
             \frac{P^*(t)d\hat{x}}{4\pi \|\textbf{x} -
\hat{\textbf{x}}\|^2}
\]
The total irradiance and flux is the integral of each attenuated point source.
\[
\begin{split}
E(x,t) & = \int_{\Omega_{tip}} 
             \frac{P^*(t)}{4\pi \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\|^2}
             \exp\left(\mu_t^*(\textbf{x},m)
                         \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\|\right) d\hat{x}
 \\
\textbf{F}(x,t) & = \int_{\Omega_{tip}} 
             \frac{P^*(t)}{4\pi \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\|^2}
             \exp\left(\mu_t^*(\textbf{x},m) 
                         \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\|\right) 
\frac{\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}} }{ \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\| }
d\hat{x}
\end{split} 
\]
\[
  \mu_t^*(\textbf{x},m)  = 
                 {\color{red}\mu_a(\textbf{x},m)} + 
                    {\color{red}\mu_s(\textbf{x},m)}  
\]
\textbf{${\color{red}\mu_t(\textbf{x},m)}$ should be the average over
the path length for the heterogenious case}.
An analytic solution may be obtained by approximating the integral for
the irradiance and flux as
\[
\begin{split}
E(x,t) 
  & \approx 
  \sum_{e\in \Omega_{tip}} E_e(x,t)
  =
  \sum_{e\in \Omega_{tip}} 
          \frac{\Delta V_e P^*(t)}{4\pi \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}_e\|^2}
          \exp\left(\mu_t^*(\textbf{x},m) 
                 \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}_e\|\right) 
 \\
\textbf{F}(x,t) 
  & \approx 
    \sum_{e\in \Omega_{tip}} \textbf{F}_e(x,t) 
  = \sum_{e\in \Omega_{tip}} 
          \frac{\Delta V_e P^*(t)}{4\pi \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\|^2}
          \exp\left(\mu_t^*(\textbf{x},m) 
                         \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\|\right) 
\frac{\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}} }{ \|\textbf{x} - \hat{\textbf{x}}\| }
\end{split} 
\]
where $\Delta V_e$ is the volume and 
$\hat{\textbf{x}}_e$ is the centroid.
By linearity, each element in the discretization may be treated as
an uncoupled and independent source in the light diffusion equation.
\[
 -{\color{red}\mu_a(\textbf{x})} z_e 
 +{\color{red}\mu_s^*(\textbf{x},m)} E_e
 = \nabla \cdot 
   \left( 
   - \frac{ \nabla z_e }{3\mu_{tr}(\textbf{x},m)} 
   + \frac{ {\color{red}\mu_s^*}(\textbf{x},m) g^* }{3\mu_{tr}(\textbf{x},m)} 
       (\textbf{F})_e
   \right) \qquad \forall e \in \Omega_{tip}
\]
The fluence resulting from each element source $(\varphi_t)_e$
may be obtained from the classical isotropic point source
solution \cite{Welch95}.
The total emanating fluence is the superposition of the element wise
solutions and reduces to a volume weighted sum over the elements.
\[
   \varphi_t = \sum_{e \in \Omega_{tip}}
 {\color{red}P^*(t)}  V_e  \left(
   \frac{3\mu_{tr} \exp(-\mu_{eff} \|\textbf{x} -{\color{red}\textbf{x}_e}\|) }
      {4\pi \|\textbf{x}-{\color{red}\textbf{x}_e}\|}
 - 
      \frac{ 
             \exp(-\mu_t^* \|\textbf{x} -{\color{red}\textbf{x}_e}\|) }
           {2\pi \|\textbf{x}-{\color{red}\textbf{x}_e}\|^2}
   \right)
\approx
    \sum_{e \in \Omega_{tip}}
 {\color{red}P^*(t)}  V_e 
   \frac{3\mu_{tr} \exp(-\mu_{eff} \|\textbf{x} -{\color{red}\textbf{x}_e}\|) }
      {4\pi \|\textbf{x}-{\color{red}\textbf{x}_e}\|}
\]
\[
 \mu_{eff}(\textbf{x},m)  = 
           \sqrt{ 3 {\color{red}\mu_a(\textbf{x},m)} \mu_{tr}(\textbf{x},m) }
\]
